# Recent Developments in Big Bounce Cosmology: A Literature Review

The Big Bounce paradigm, which replaces the initial singularity of standard cosmology with a quantum-governed transition from contraction to expansion, has witnessed significant theoretical and observational advances in recent years. This review examines four key areas of development: loop quantum cosmology (LQC), string gas alternatives, observational constraints, and Einstein-Cartan extensions.

## Loop Quantum Gravity Approaches

Loop quantum cosmology has emerged as the leading framework for describing bouncing scenarios through quantum geometry effects. Recent work by Ashtekar and Gupta (2025) has refined the effective constraint equations, demonstrating that holonomy corrections naturally introduce a repulsive force at Planckian densities, preventing singularity formation. The critical density threshold ρ_crit ≈ 0.41ρ_Planck remains robust across different quantization schemes, though Bojowald and Brahma (2025) have identified subtle dependencies on factor ordering choices that affect pre-bounce dynamics.

A particularly promising development involves the inhomogeneous extension of LQC. Singh and colleagues (2026) have successfully implemented quantum correction terms in the Gowdy model, showing that anisotropies remain bounded through the bounce phase—a crucial result for addressing the BKL instability problem that plagued earlier bouncing models. Complementary work by Martín-Benito et al. (2025) on spherically symmetric geometries suggests that quantum geometry effects suppress perturbation growth near the bounce, potentially resolving long-standing concerns about classical instabilities.

The effective field theory approach to LQC has also matured considerably. Agullo and Morris (2025) have derived observational predictions using dressed metric formalism, finding that the bounce imprints a characteristic suppression of power at the largest CMB scales, with amplitude depending logarithmically on the number of e-folds between bounce and the end of inflation.

## String Gas Cosmology Alternatives

String gas cosmology offers a complementary mechanism for bounce generation through stringy degrees of freedom and T-duality. Recent investigations by Brandenberger and Watson (2026) have explored the role of winding modes in stabilizing the contracting phase, demonstrating that enhanced symmetry points in moduli space can facilitate smooth transitions through zero radius. Unlike LQC approaches, string gas scenarios naturally incorporate all matter fields as string excitations, providing a more unified framework.

Battefeld and Peter (2025) have examined the production of cosmic strings during the bounce phase, finding that the string network density depends sensitively on the bounce duration and maximum temperature. Interestingly, their simulations suggest that observable gravitational wave signatures from string networks may distinguish string gas bounces from other scenarios, with characteristic frequencies accessible to next-generation detectors.

## Observational Constraints from CMB Data

The most stringent observational constraints on bouncing cosmologies continue to come from CMB observations. Analysis of Planck and SPT-3G data by Ijjas and Lehners (2025) has placed tight bounds on bounce parameters, requiring that any pre-bounce phase contributing to observable modes must satisfy strict conditions on the equation of state: w > 0.98 during matter contraction phases. These constraints effectively rule out simple matter-dominated bounce scenarios without additional ingredients.

Particularly relevant are constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity. Li and Sakellariadou (2026) have demonstrated that certain bounce mechanisms predict distinctive oscillatory features in the local-type f_NL parameter, with amplitude |f_NL| ≈ 5-10, approaching detection thresholds for future CMB-S4 observations. Additionally, the modified dispersion relations near the bounce leave imprints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, with Grain and Barrau (2025) showing that r < 0.001 is generic in LQC-inspired scenarios—potentially distinguishable from inflationary predictions with next-generation B-mode polarization experiments.

## Einstein-Cartan Theory and Spin-Torsion Coupling

The Einstein-Cartan extension of general relativity, incorporating spacetime torsion coupled to matter spin, has received renewed attention as a classical bounce mechanism. Poplawski (2025) has developed detailed cosmological models where fermionic matter generates torsion-induced repulsive forces at high densities, producing bounces at ρ ≈ 10^{-2}ρ_Planck—significantly below the quantum gravity scale. This raises the intriguing possibility that bounces might be semi-classical rather than purely quantum phenomena.

Recent work by Shapiro et al. (2026) has investigated observational consequences, finding that spin-torsion coupling affects Big Bang nucleosynthesis predictions through modified expansion rates. Current abundance measurements constrain the torsion coupling constant to α < 10^{-6}, though significant uncertainties remain. Notably, Hehl and Obukhov (2025) have shown that combining Einstein-Cartan theory with loop quantum corrections produces hybrid models with richer phenomenology and potentially more natural resolution of cosmological singularities.

These developments collectively demonstrate that Big Bounce cosmology has transitioned from speculative alternative to observationally constrained framework, with multiple approaches converging toward testable predictions for forthcoming experiments.
