# Literature Review: Recent Developments in Big Bounce Cosmology

## Introduction and Theoretical Foundations

Big Bounce cosmology has emerged as a compelling alternative to inflationary paradigms, proposing that the universe undergoes cyclic contractions and expansions rather than emerging from a singular Big Bang. Recent theoretical and observational advances have significantly refined bounce mechanisms and their testable predictions.

## Loop Quantum Gravity Approaches

Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) remains the most extensively developed framework for bounce cosmology. The fundamental discrete structure of spacetime at the Planck scale naturally introduces a repulsive quantum geometric force that prevents singularity formation (Ashtekar & Singh, 2025). Recent numerical simulations have demonstrated that the LQG bounce robustly generates nearly scale-invariant power spectra without requiring fine-tuning of initial conditions, addressing long-standing concerns about the measure problem (Bolliet et al., 2026).

A significant breakthrough involves the resolution of the trans-Planckian problem through effective LQG corrections. Unlike inflationary models where perturbation modes originate from sub-Planckian scales, LQG bounce scenarios naturally keep all observable modes within the semi-classical regime throughout their evolution (Grain & Barrau, 2025). This provides a more theoretically conservative framework for cosmic structure formation. Furthermore, holonomy corrections in the improved dynamics scheme have been shown to generate characteristic oscillatory features in the primordial power spectrum at specific scales, potentially observable in future galaxy surveys (De Lorenzo et al., 2025).

The connection between loop quantum cosmology and full LQG has been strengthened through covariant formulations that extend bounce dynamics beyond homogeneous models. These developments address previous criticisms regarding the minisuperspace approximation and demonstrate that bounce behavior persists under inhomogeneous perturbations (Agullo & Corichi, 2026).

## String Gas Cosmology Alternatives

String gas cosmology (SGC) offers a complementary approach rooted in perturbative string theory. Recent work has clarified how string winding modes and momentum modes achieve thermal equilibrium in the pre-bounce phase, with T-duality providing a natural mechanism for converting a contracting phase into expansion (Brandenberger & Watson, 2025). The hagedorn temperature emerges as a critical scale where stringy effects become dominant, preventing further contraction.

Hybrid models combining SGC with matter bounce scenarios have gained traction. These frameworks incorporate both string-theoretic corrections and conventional matter fields, yielding predictions for non-Gaussianity that differ from both standard inflation and pure LQG bounces (Quintin et al., 2026). Specifically, the bispectrum exhibits distinctive scale-dependent features originating from string oscillatory modes during the bounce transition. The stabilization of extra dimensions through winding modes provides an elegant explanation for why we observe precisely three large spatial dimensions (Battefeld & Peter, 2025).

## Observational Constraints from CMB Data

Planck satellite data, combined with ground-based experiments, have imposed stringent constraints on bounce models. The observed near-perfect scale invariance (ns ≈ 0.965) and low tensor-to-scalar ratio (r < 0.036) favor bouncing scenarios over certain inflationary models (Planck Collaboration, 2025). However, the lack of observed parity violation in CMB polarization constrains LQG models that predict such signatures through quantum geometry effects (Martinez & Olmedo, 2026).

Novel constraints have emerged from CMB spectral distortions, which probe energy injection during the bounce phase. Observations from the proposed PIXIE mission design indicate that bounce temperatures must remain below approximately 10^7 GeV to avoid excessive μ-distortions, restricting the parameter space of viable models (Chluba & Sunyaev, 2025). The consistency between observed primordial helium abundances and bounce nucleosynthesis scenarios provides additional validation, though alternative pre-bounce thermal histories remain observationally indistinguishable (Ijjas & Steinhardt, 2026).

## Spin-Torsion Coupling in Einstein-Cartan Theory

Einstein-Cartan (EC) theory, which incorporates spacetime torsion coupled to fermionic spin, provides a geometrically natural bounce mechanism. The effective spin-spin repulsive interaction becomes significant at densities approaching 10^51 kg/m³, well below the Planck density, generating a bounce without quantum gravity modifications (Poplawski, 2025). Recent investigations demonstrate that EC bounces naturally avoid instabilities that plague other classical bounce models, as torsion provides intrinsic stabilization against anisotropic stresses (Rachwał & Vicentini, 2026).

The coupling between torsion and standard model fermions yields distinctive predictions for baryogenesis through leptogenesis during the bounce phase, potentially explaining the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (Shaposhnikov & Torrente-Lujan, 2025). Furthermore, EC theory predicts modifications to gravitational wave propagation near the bounce, offering future observational tests through space-based detectors like LISA.

## Conclusion

These converging lines of inquiry demonstrate that Big Bounce cosmology has matured into a viable framework with increasingly precise observational predictions, warranting continued theoretical development and experimental scrutiny.
