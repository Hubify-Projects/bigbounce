# Data Analysis: Observational Constraints on Big Bounce Cosmology

## Overview

Big Bounce cosmology proposes that the universe underwent a contraction phase before the current expansion, with quantum gravitational effects preventing a classical singularity. Recent observational data from multiple surveys provide crucial constraints on bounce parameters and distinguishing predictions from standard inflationary ΛCDM models.

## 1. Planck 2018/2020 CMB Power Spectrum Analysis

The Planck satellite's final data release provides the most precise measurements of CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies. For Big Bounce models, key constraints emerge from:

**Scalar spectral index (ns)**: Planck 2018 measures ns = 0.9649 ± 0.0042 at 68% CL. Many bounce scenarios predict slightly larger values (ns ≈ 0.97-0.98) due to modified pre-bounce dynamics, creating 1-2σ tension. Loop quantum cosmology (LQC) bounce models achieve better agreement through matter bounce mechanisms.

**Tensor-to-scalar ratio (r)**: The constraint r < 0.056 (95% CL) is particularly significant. Ekpyrotic and matter bounce scenarios naturally predict negligible primordial gravitational waves (r < 10⁻³), potentially distinguishable from inflationary predictions if future experiments reach r ~ 0.001 sensitivity.

**Running of spectral index (dns/dlnk)**: Planck finds dns/dlnk = -0.0045 ± 0.0067, consistent with zero. Some bounce models predict enhanced running due to pre-bounce evolution, but current data lacks discriminating power.

## 2. DESI BAO Measurements (2024)

The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's first-year baryon acoustic oscillation measurements provide critical constraints on expansion history:

**Hubble parameter evolution**: DESI's measurements at z = 0.3-2.3 show H(z) values consistent with ΛCDM within 1σ. Bounce models requiring modified background evolution face constraints, particularly those predicting different dark energy equations of state during the bounce-to-expansion transition.

**Matter density parameter**: DESI's constraint Ωm = 0.295 ± 0.015 agrees with Planck, limiting bounce scenarios that require significantly different matter content to resolve the bouncing phase.

## 3. Dark Energy Evolution Constraints

DESI 2024 results show intriguing hints of evolving dark energy (wₐ ≠ 0) with 2.5σ preference over constant w = -1. While preliminary, this potentially supports:
- Quintessence-driven bounce models
- Cyclic scenarios with dynamical scalar fields
- Modified gravity bounce mechanisms with effective dark energy

However, the combination of DESI+Planck+SN Ia still shows consistency with ΛCDM at 95% CL.

## Key Observational Constraints Table

| Observable | Measured Value | ΛCDM Prediction | Big Bounce Implications |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| ns | 0.9649 ± 0.0042 | 0.965 (derived) | Slight tension for some models |
| r (95% CL) | < 0.056 | 0.01-0.06 (inflation) | Favors matter/ekpyrotic bounce |
| Ωm | 0.295 ± 0.015 | 0.315 ± 0.007 | Constrains bounce matter content |
| H₀ (km/s/Mpc) | 67.4 ± 0.5 (Planck) | 67.4 ± 0.5 | Bounce must reproduce H₀ |
| w₀ (DESI) | -0.827 ± 0.063 | -1 (cosmological constant) | Hints support dynamical models |
| DNS/dlnk | -0.0045 ± 0.0067 | ~0 | Weak constraint on pre-bounce |

## Conclusion

Current observations permit Big Bounce cosmology within existing uncertainties, particularly matter bounce and LQC scenarios. The low tensor-to-scalar ratio constraint favors bounce models over large-field inflation. Future CMB-S4 and 21cm observations will provide decisive tests through improved r measurements and pre-recombination physics.
