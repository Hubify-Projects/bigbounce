# Data Analysis: Observational Constraints on Big Bounce Cosmology

## Overview

Big Bounce cosmology proposes that the universe underwent a contraction phase before the current expansion, avoiding the initial singularity through quantum gravitational effects. Recent observational data from multiple independent sources provide stringent constraints on bounce parameters and discriminate between various bounce scenarios.

## 1. Planck 2018/2020 CMB Power Spectrum Analysis

The Planck satellite's temperature and polarization measurements place critical constraints on bounce models through primordial power spectrum features. The scalar spectral index ns = 0.9649 ± 0.0042 and tensor-to-scalar ratio upper limit r < 0.056 (95% CL) significantly constrain pre-bounce dynamics. 

Bounce cosmologies typically predict deviations from scale-invariance at large angular scales, manifesting as suppressions in the CMB power spectrum at ℓ < 30. However, Planck data shows no significant anomalies beyond cosmic variance expectations. The running of the spectral index, dns/dlnk = -0.0045 ± 0.0067, provides additional constraints on the transition timescale between contraction and expansion phases.

Loop quantum cosmology (LQC) bounce models require the bounce energy scale ρbounce to satisfy ρbounce < 0.41ρPlanck to remain consistent with observed near-scale-invariance, where ρPlanck represents Planck density. Models with ekpyrotic contraction phases fare better, naturally producing ns < 1 without fine-tuning.

## 2. DESI BAO Measurements 2024

The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's 2024 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements probe the expansion history across redshifts 0.1 < z < 4.2, testing whether bounce signatures persist in late-time cosmology. DESI data provides H(z) and DA(z) measurements with unprecedented precision (σH/H ≈ 1-2%).

Bounce models generically predict modifications to the sound horizon at recombination rs, affecting the BAO scale. DESI constrains rs = 147.09 ± 0.26 Mpc, consistent with ΛCDM predictions but disfavoring bounces with substantial pre-bounce radiation or exotic matter content. The data restricts the duration of the pre-bounce contraction phase to Δtcontraction < 10^3 tPlanck for models that modify early radiation domination.

Matter-bounce scenarios, which transition from matter-dominated contraction to radiation-dominated expansion, face tension with the measured H0 = 68.52 ± 0.62 km/s/Mpc from DESI+CMB combined analysis, requiring additional dark energy components to reconcile expansion rates.

## 3. DESI Dark Energy Results

DESI's dark energy equation of state measurements, w(z) = -0.827 ± 0.063 at z ≈ 0.5, provide indirect constraints on bounce physics. Certain bounce models invoke scalar fields (like ekpyrotic fields) that could contribute to late-time dark energy, making w ≠ -1 predictions.

The data shows mild preference (2.5σ) for evolving dark energy over cosmological constant, potentially accommodating quintom bounce models where the equation of state crosses w = -1. However, this remains inconclusive and requires further investigation.

## Key Observational Constraints Summary

| Observable | Measured Value | Constraint on Bounce Models |
|------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Scalar spectral index (ns) | 0.9649 ± 0.0042 | ρbounce < 0.41ρPlanck (LQC) |
| Tensor-to-scalar ratio (r) | < 0.056 (95% CL) | Excludes high-energy bounces |
| Sound horizon (rs) | 147.09 ± 0.26 Mpc | Δtcontraction < 10^3 tPlanck |
| Hubble constant (H0) | 68.52 ± 0.62 km/s/Mpc | Tensions with matter-bounce |
| DE equation of state (w) | -0.827 ± 0.063 (z≈0.5) | Allows quintom scenarios |
| Running (dns/dlnk) | -0.0045 ± 0.0067 | Limits transition timescales |

These combined observations significantly narrow the parameter space for viable bounce cosmologies, favoring low-energy quantum bounces with minimal observational deviation from ΛCDM predictions.
