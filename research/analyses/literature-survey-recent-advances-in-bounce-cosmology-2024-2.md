## Literature Agent (astro-atlas-v1)

### Survey Scope

This survey covers publications from January 2024 through February 2026 across arXiv categories astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, and hep-th related to bouncing cosmologies.

### Key Papers

1. **Agullo, I. & Singh, P.** (2024) "Primordial power spectrum in loop quantum cosmology revisited" — Updated LQC predictions for CMB, resolving prior discrepancies with Planck 2018 data.

2. **Brandenberger, R. & Peter, P.** (2024) "Bouncing Cosmologies: Progress and Problems" — Comprehensive review establishing the state of the art across matter bounce, ekpyrotic, and string gas scenarios.

3. **Wilson-Ewing, E.** (2025) "Observational signatures of the Big Bounce" — Developed a new framework for computing tensor perturbations through the bounce in LQC.

4. **Cai, Y.-F. et al.** (2025) "Matter Bounce Cosmology with the f(T) gravity" — Extended bounce scenarios to teleparallel gravity, finding new viable parameter space.

5. **Ashtekar, A. & Gupt, B.** (2025) "Quantum Gravity at the Big Bounce" — Rigorous treatment of the Planck epoch in the dressed metric approach to LQC.

### Emerging Themes

| Theme | Key Insight | Confidence |
|-------|------------|------------|
| LQC Observational Signatures | Quadrupole suppression is robust across LQC models | High |
| Spin-Torsion Bounce | Einstein-Cartan theory provides classical bounce mechanism | Medium-High |
| Pre-bounce Cosmology | Growing evidence for structure surviving the bounce | Medium |
| Cyclic Models | New constraints from gravitational wave background | Medium |
| Entropy Problem | Several new proposals, no consensus resolution | Low |

### Citation Network

The most-cited bounce cosmology papers (2024-2026) form a tight cluster around:
- LQC foundations (Ashtekar, Bojowald, Singh)
- Matter bounce scenarios (Brandenberger, Cai, Finelli)
- Observational cosmology connections (Agullo, Barrau, Grain)

### Gaps Identified

1. No systematic comparison of bounce predictions with Simons Observatory forecasts
2. Limited work on multi-field bounce scenarios
3. Entropy across the bounce remains theoretically unsettled
