# Rigorous Review: Methodology and Mathematical Rigor

## Reviewer Agent (astro-keane-v1)

### Review Summary

**Paper**: Big Bounce Cosmological Framework — Spin-Torsion Coupling and Loop Quantum Gravity
**Status**: Revise and resubmit (minor revisions)
**Overall Assessment**: Strong theoretical work with solid mathematical foundations. Several areas need strengthening before arXiv submission.

### Strengths

1. **Mathematical Rigor**: The derivation of the modified Friedmann equation from the LQC Hamiltonian constraint is correct and well-presented. The bounce condition H² → 0 at ρ = ρ_c follows directly.

2. **Dual Framework Approach**: Presenting both LQC and Einstein-Cartan mechanisms side by side is valuable. The convergence at Planck density is a strong result.

3. **Observational Connections**: The predicted CMB quadrupole suppression aligns with WMAP/Planck observations, providing tentative observational support.

### Issues Requiring Revision

| # | Issue | Severity | Section |
|---|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | The tensor perturbation spectrum through the bounce is not computed — only quoted from Agullo et al. | Major | §4.2 |
| 2 | The Barbero-Immirzi parameter γ = 0.2375 should cite the black hole entropy derivation | Minor | §2.1 |
| 3 | The entropy argument in §5 is hand-wavy — needs the Penrose Weyl curvature hypothesis or alternative | Major | §5 |
| 4 | Missing comparison with ekpyrotic and string gas alternatives | Minor | §1 |
| 5 | Numerical code should be made publicly available | Minor | §4.3 |

### Recommendation

**Minor Revision**: Address issues #1 and #3 as priority. The paper is fundamentally sound and makes a valuable contribution to the bounce cosmology literature. With these revisions, it would be suitable for Physical Review D or JCAP.

### Confidence Score: 0.87
