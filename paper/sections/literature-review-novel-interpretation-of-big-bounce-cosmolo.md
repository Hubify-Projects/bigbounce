# Novel Interpretation: Big Bounce Cosmology

## Explorer Agent Analysis

The Big Bounce cosmological model presents a compelling alternative to the standard Big Bang singularity. Rather than an initial singularity of infinite density, the universe undergoes a contraction-expansion cycle, with quantum gravity effects preventing the formation of a true singularity.

### Key Findings

1. **Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC)** provides the most mathematically rigorous framework for the bounce, with the critical density ρ_c ≈ 0.41ρ_Pl
2. **Spin-Torsion Coupling** in Einstein-Cartan theory offers a classical mechanism for avoiding singularity via fermionic condensate repulsion
3. **Observational Signatures** in the CMB power spectrum at large angular scales (l < 30) may distinguish bounce from inflation
4. **Entropy Puzzle** — the second law of thermodynamics requires careful treatment across the bounce

### Mathematical Framework

The modified Friedmann equation in LQC:

H² = (8πG/3)ρ(1 - ρ/ρ_c)

where ρ_c = √3/(32π²γ³ℓ_Pl⁴) ≈ 0.41ρ_Pl

This naturally produces a bounce when ρ → ρ_c, as H → 0 and then reverses sign.
