  headline:
    "Portfolio restructured to Track A (bounce vs. inflation, flagship) / Track B (the ECH Note) / Track C (DESI data products), replacing the retired three-research-programs framing (directive R3). P1N and P4′ are freshly merged/folded drafts, not yet scored — P1A, P1C, P4, and P5 remain listed as their archived lineage.",
  summary:
    "P1N (Track B) merges P1A into P1C as one closed-line ECH Note. P4′ (Track C1) folds P5 into P4 and adds the Poplawski black-hole-universe spin-axis exclusion. Both are fresh drafts (readiness cap 20, no review board run yet). P2 remains gated toward P2′ pending the ledger #1 independent re-derivation. P3 is provenance support for the redirected early-universe anomaly map.",
  currentlyRunning: [
    "Deterministic preflight, clean-room package compiles, link checks, mirror checks, and all-page visual audits pass; bounded reviewer confirmation remains version-specific.",
    "Houston's final review applies only after a program-level scientific and editorial decision; it is not implied by an automated review result.",
