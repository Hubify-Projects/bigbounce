    description: "Paper 1A — the foundational ECH structural-closure no-go theorem (theory-focused, PRD target). Establishes 14 independent structural barriers that close every minimal route from the quantum bounce to late-time dark energy. The central result is the perturbation-transparency theorem: for canonical scalar matter, torsion vanishes at all perturbation orders, the Holst dual contraction vanishes identically by the first Bianchi identity, and the Holst sector decouples from all scalar/tensor perturbation observables. The structural-tension §III argument shows the dark-energy mechanism (requiring N_tot ≈ 92 post-bounce e-folds) is incompatible with the fNL/f_NL = -35/8 matter-bounce signature. Companion technical verification material lives in Paper 1B.",
